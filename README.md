# Introduction
**This project was created to achieve several things outlined below:**
- Process a pair of dates input as comma separated values and calculate the difference between them in days without using Date() or similar.
- Implement Jest Unit Tests onto critical functionality.
- Demonstrate a wide variety of techniques to perform calculations.
- Use MobX with a locally defined store structure to further demonstrate the flexibility of this store management library.

**This project was NOT created to demonstrate beautifully structured functional composition**
Whilst there are aspects of functional composition present, the main purpose here was to explore and demonstrate a broader usage of shorthand techniques that could produce the desired outcome quickly.
